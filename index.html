    A scale is a function that you can use to transform a data set into data values that are more useable to create a visualization.
    For example, if you wanted to make a bar graph and were given a data set that had vaules between 100 and 4000, you would not
    want to use these values in your bar graph because your bar graph would take up your entire screen. So, you should use a scale 
    to map your data set with your domain as [100,4000] and your range to smaller values like [0,300], allowing all your data to 
    be scaled into your newly defined range. Therefore, scale is useful in visualization because it allows users to view data in a more
    concise way. And also, when using a scatterplot you can use rscale to scale the radius of each point on the scatterplot depending 
    on how small or large the value is withing the data set. This allows a user to be able to visually see how many large values are
    in the data set and how many small values are in the data set.
